# SOC-Home-Lab
This lab is to show and/or practice the following skills:

-Research SOC best practices, study SOC workflows, and familiarize yourself with common SOC tools and technologies.

-Use of tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), firewalls, and endpoint protection solutions.

-Use of scripts and automation tools to collect logs from devices, parse and normalize data, and store it in a central repository (e.g., a SIEM system).

-Ability to write custom detection rules for your SIEM or IDS/IPS, set up alerting mechanisms, and automate responses to common threats.

-Use tools like Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, The Hive, Shuffle, Wazuh or custom scripts to simulate various attack scenarios, and analyze how your SOC tools and processes respond.

-Ability to develop playbooks for common incident types, and use SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tools to automate steps, and integrate these with your SOC workflows.

-Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring, conduct regular reviews of detection and response metrics, and iterate on your tools and processes based on feedback and new threat intelligence.
